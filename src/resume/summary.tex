% Leading a team of 2 undergraduates to manage 2 projects simultaneously 
% I am a highly motivated scientist with a broad range of interdisciplinary skills. With extensive experience as a graduate researcher I have honed and developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills that I apply to complex problems. My interests lie primarily in the fields of Bioinformatics (Genetics \& Health Informatics), MachineLearning, and AI. I am a self-starter who is constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow. 

% In addition to my scientific skills, I am proficient in Linux and other tools that help me work efficiently and effectively.

% As an \em{interdisciplinary scientist,} I am driven by curiosity and self-motivation to explore new areas of science. With extensive experience as a graduate researcher, I have developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills that I apply to complex problems. My interests lie primarily in the fields of Bioinformatics, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, where I am passionate about using data to drive insights and improve decision-making

% Self-motivated, analytical and \em{interdisciplinary} scientist with extensive experience as a graduate researcher.
% A nerd who loves Spacemacs \& Linux and enjoys exploring new areas of science, mostly in the fields of Bioinformatics (Genetics, Health Informatics), Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
